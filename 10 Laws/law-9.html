            <p><b>Information as Fundamental:</b> A growing movement in physics suggests that information, not matter or energy, may be the most fundamental constituent of reality. The state of any particle can be described entirely by its information content (e.g., its qubits).</p>
            <p><b>Conservation of Information:</b> A key principle in quantum mechanics is that total information is never lost. It can be scrambled (like in a black hole), but the underlying information must be conserved.</p>
            <p><b>Quantum Entanglement:</b> Two or more particles can become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are. Measuring a property of one particle instantly influences the corresponding property of the other. This suggests a connection that is non-local (transcends space).</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>‚ú® Non-Locality:</strong> The soul is not "located" in the brain. It is an informational field that interfaces with the brain. This allows for a connection to God that is independent of physical space.</li>
                        <li><strong>üîó Divine Entanglement:</strong> The soul was created to be "entangled" with its Creator. Prayer, worship, and salvation are processes that strengthen this quantum-like informational bond.</li>
                        <li><strong>üíæ Information Conservation:</strong> The principle of quantum information conservation provides a physical basis for eternal life. The physical body (the "hardware") may decay, but the soul's unique informational pattern (the "software") is conserved and returns to its source.</li>

                            <p>In a quantum entanglement experiment, two photons are created and sent in opposite directions. When physicists measure the polarization of Photon A, they instantly know the polarization of Photon B, even if it is miles away. Their informational connection is instantaneous and transcends space.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Christ as the Perfect Information Template</h2>
            <p>Christ is the "Logos," the perfect, uncorrupted Word or Information of God. Our souls, corrupted by sin (informational noise), are "saved" when they are recalibrated against His perfect template. Salvation is a process of informational restoration.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Testable Prediction</h2>
            <p>This model predicts that consciousness-based anomalies should be measurable. Specifically, synchronized prayer or meditation from spiritually "entangled" groups (e.g., families, long-term faith communities) should produce statistically significant deviations in random event generators (REGs) at a higher rate than from groups of strangers, demonstrating a nonlocal informational coherence.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This law is the essence of the C (Consciousness) component. C acts as the system's "observer" and interface. It is the consciousness that collapses the probabilities of Q (Choice), perceives the truth of E (Light), and experiences the state of S (Entropy). It is the ultimate "reader" of the equation's output, œá, which represents the total state of the soul.</p>
